**NOTE: Please remember to open the workspace before beginning on the lab activities**  

## Lab Warmup - Hello World
Once your development environment is setup and running, please watch the [Walkthrough Video](https://boisestate.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?pid=22bfc4b0-4874-4529-8fd0-b0120164dc87).   
### Problem Description

For each of the following steps, end the program's output with a newline.

1. Write a program that outputs the following.  

```
Hello world!
```

2. Update to output the following.  

```
Hello world!
How are you? 
```

3. Finally, update to output the following.  

```
Hello world!
How are you?
   (I'm fine).
``` 


### Implementation Guide
1. Expand the folder named LabWarmup and open the file named main.c
2. Enter the program code from the Problem Description
3. Test the program using to ensure it functions as expected.
4. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that LabWarmup is completed.
5. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.
6. Update the Coding Journal with an entry describing your experience using the steps outlined below. (optional)

## Lab Activity
### Problem Description
The objective for Lab01 is to simply become familiar with the development environment and the development workflow. To receive full credit for the activity portion of this lab, please take a screenshot of your development environment showing the source code for the Lab Warmup open in either VSCode or VIM depending upon how your development environment is configured.

### Implementation Guide
1. Take a screenshot of development environment as described. To capture the screenshot using the BoiseStateBudgie VM, simply press the Prt/Scn button on your keyboard.  You'll find the screenshot image in the Pictures directory.
2. Add the file to the LabActivity folder in the code repository.
3. Commit the changes to your local repository with a message stating that LabActivity is completed.
4. Push the changes from your local repository to the github classroom repository.


## Coding Journal (Optional)
Keep a journal of your activities as you work on this lab. Many of the best engineers that I have worked with professionally have kept some sort of engineering journal. I personally packed notebooks around with me for nearly 8 years before I began keeping my notes electronically.   

Your journal can track ideas, bugs, cool links, code snippets, shell commands, rants, or simply a reflection on what worked well or not-so-well with this lab activity. I will not be grading the content of your journal, but I will expect at least two timestamped journal entries of at least a 75 to 150 words each added to the provided Journal.md file.  The purpose of this component is to help develop the habit of taking notes and creating documentation while you code. The more detail you provide the better as that will help you if you ever need to refer back to this project in the future.

## Markdown Resources
Markdown is a notation that is used to format text documents.  It is widely used in Software Development shops around the world, which is why we're asking you to use it in your lab documentation.  

Github provides a guide for getting started:  [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
