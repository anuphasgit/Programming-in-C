In this lab I learned to use printf and scanf in C. I used the printf in the lab activity to print out a tree and a cat which reminded me of my early CS121 classes. I used the scanf in the lab warmup to input a number from the user. Then, did some mathematical operations like addition, multiplication, cubing, and squaring with that number. It was a great way to practice what I had learned from the zybooks.
